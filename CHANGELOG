[06/12/2024] - [0.10.0] - Updated Packages:

1. FEATURE: Initially we had an open communication room, any user could enter the room and type a text, and that way everyone would see the message sent, now we isolate conversations by users.

- Problems that still need attention:

1. Improve the style of the users section available to start a conversation, in contrast to active chat.
2. View the message sent by the users themselves.
